### I like problems where understanding matters more than tooling.


Mostly working with **C++** and **math-heavy** problems.
I enjoy simulations, low-level logic, and analysing why something behaves the way it does.

Right now:
- Writing small C++ projects to improve reasoning, memory, and structure
- Experimenting with JavaScript + Canvas for math visualizations
- Pushing problem-solving from medium toward hard
